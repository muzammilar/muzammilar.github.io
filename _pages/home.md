I'm a Research Assistant at <a href="http://ccis.neu.edu">College of Computer & Information Science, Northeastern University </a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://david.choffnes.com">David Choffnes</a>.

Before joining Northeastern in the Fall 2015, I attended <a href="http://lums.edu.pk/"> Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)</a> in Lahore, Pakistan and earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

I'm passionate about design and implementation of tools that improve the privacy, reliability, and scalability of real world systems and networks by applying techniques used in Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics.
