<h2 class="">
  <smallcaps>Passport:</smallcaps> Country-level Router Geolocation
</h2>
<p>
  Internet routing is based on Internet Service Provider (ISP) policies.
  These policies are usually kept private by the ISPs.
  Current geolocation services use limited information and measurements to geolocate routers.
  Therefore, these current geolocation services have a low accuracy for router locations.
  In this project, we are using the applications of Machine Learning on existing, inaccurate geolocation sources, router information, and Internet measurements to develop an algorithm (and a system based on this algorithm) to address the task of predicting router locations.
  Utilizing this information, this project aims at quantifying the impact of foreign governments on Internet paths and developing a prototype to avoid them.

<h4>Website:</h4>
<p>
  Our website is now live in pre-alpha phase!
  The core functionality has been developed in Python (Flask, Scikit-Learn, and Django) and the Frontend was built using D3 and Bootstrap.
  We're adding more functionality by every passing day.

<h2 class="">
  Cyclone: Dynamic Cloud Virtualization
</h2>
<p>
  Cyclone is a dynamic cloud virtualization system that can manipulate the the cloud environment.
  It supports dynamic capabilities such as controlling time, shape and inputs.
  In this project, we aimed at leveraging large-scale system resources, program analysis and partial execution to ensure cloud replay in a cost-effective manner.
  It was a collaborative project between University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and LUMS and a prototype implementation is still under works by the research groups.

<h2 class="">
  Distributed and Secure Veriflow
</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/papers/khurshid13veriflow.pdf">Veriflow</a> is an online networks invariant verifier developed by UIUC.
  It sits in as layer between the control and data plane to verify network invariants.
  Our research primarily focused on extending Veriflow to allow for a private and verifiable inter-domain routing (between different Veriflow instances) without compromising the space and time complexities of the verifying global network invariants (such as, checking for forwading loops and network black holes).

<h2 class="">
  Disease Surveillance using Twitter
</h2>
<p>
  Twitter streams are used in various analyses, including and not limited to predicting election results and disease trends.
  Our work focused on the reliability of twitter as a source of disease surveillance.
  We gathered 2 million tweets for dengue and influenza during the year 2012-13, classified them in various groups and analyzed the usefulness of twitter as source of epidemic prediction, resource information, personal experience and advertisement in various countries for a given timeline.
  However, with the large amounts of noise in the data didn't, the results didnâ€™t show a significant promise to target a publication.
